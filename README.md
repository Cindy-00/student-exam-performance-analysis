Data analysis of student exam performance by demographic and preparation factors.
# 📊 Student Exam Performance Analysis

## 📝 Project Overview
This project explores how various factors — such as gender, parental education level, lunch type, and test preparation — affect student exam performance in math, reading, and writing.

It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical testing, visualizations, and actionable recommendations.

## 📁 Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle - Students Performance in Exams](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams)
- 1000 student records
- Features: gender, parental level of education, lunch type, test prep course, scores in math, reading, and writing

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand score distributions by subject
- Analyze the impact of demographic and preparation factors
- Test hypotheses statistically
- Offer data-driven recommendations for educational interventions

---

## 🔍 Key Findings
- Students who completed test prep scored significantly higher across all subjects.
- Female students outperformed males in reading and writing.
- Strong correlations exist between all three exam scores.

---

## 📊 Techniques Used
- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy)
- Data cleaning & transformation
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- T-tests for statistical significance
- Correlation heatmaps

---

## 🛠️ Tools
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python 3.13.3
- Git/GitHub

---

## 📌 Recommendations
1. Invest in test prep programs for all students.
2. Provide reading/writing support especially for male students.
3. Use subject performance trends to predict and support students at risk.
